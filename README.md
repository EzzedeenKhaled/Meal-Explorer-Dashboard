# Assessment

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.7.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. You can check with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download all required libraries for the project.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

or

```bash
npm start
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload when you modify source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a full list of schematics (components, directives, pipes, etc.):

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Playwright End-to-End Testing

Run all Playwright tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run a single test file:

```bash
npx playwright test path/to/test-file.spec.ts
```

Open Playwright Test Runner UI:

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

Run tests in headed mode (see the browser during test execution):

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```
